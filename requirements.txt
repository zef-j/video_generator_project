# Python dependencies for the automated vertical video generator
#
# Install these packages with:
#   pip install -r requirements.txt
#
# Note: FFmpeg is required by MoviePy but must be installed separately
# and be available on your system PATH. See README.md for instructions.

PySide6>=6.5,<7.0
# Pin MoviePy to the 1.x series.  MoviePy 2.x removed the ``editor`` module
# and introduced breaking API changes.  Version 1.0.3 is the latest
# release compatible with the current code.
moviepy<2.0
pyttsx3>=2.90
numpy>=1.23
# Pillow 10.0 removed the Image.ANTIALIAS constant used internally by
# MoviePy's resize function.  To avoid AttributeError: module 'PIL.Image'
# has no attribute 'ANTIALIAS', we pin Pillow below version 10.
Pillow>=8.0,<10.0

# striprtf is used to convert RTF-formatted scripts into plain text.  Without
# this dependency, scripts containing RTF markup (e.g. exported from TextEdit or
# Word) will cause the speech synthesis to fail because of unescaped braces and
# control words.  If you cannot install this package, ensure your scripts are
# saved as plain text.
striprtf>=0.0.29
