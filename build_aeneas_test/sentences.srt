1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,520
They say in the town of Widdershade, people don't cast shadows after sunset.

2
00:00:04,520 --> 00:00:05,600
It's not magic.

3
00:00:05,600 --> 00:00:06,640
It's Felix.

4
00:00:06,640 --> 00:00:09,440
Felix Holloway wasn't always a shadow collector.

5
00:00:09,440 --> 00:00:13,120
He started out as a quiet cobbler with bad eyesight and a worse memory.

6
00:00:13,120 --> 00:00:20,560
But one cloudy evening, while fixing a boot by candlelight, he noticed something odd - the customer's shadow stepped away from him.

7
00:00:20,560 --> 00:00:23,800
It yawned, stretched, and disappeared out the window.

8
00:00:23,800 --> 00:00:24,760
Felix blinked.

9
00:00:24,760 --> 00:00:25,840
Twice.

10
00:00:25,840 --> 00:00:28,680
Then did what any sane man would: he followed it.

11
00:00:28,680 --> 00:00:37,960
He chased the shadow through cobbled alleys, up a twisted oak tree, and into a hole behind the apothecary, where - to his absolute confusion - he found a market.

12
00:00:37,960 --> 00:00:39,040
Not for fruit.

13
00:00:39,040 --> 00:00:40,200
Not for shoes.

14
00:00:40,200 --> 00:00:41,200
But for shadows.

15
00:00:41,200 --> 00:00:49,400
Tall ones, crooked ones, shadows that danced when you whistled - all hanging on clotheslines, whispering like curtains in the wind.

16
00:00:49,400 --> 00:00:53,080
A woman with silver eyes traded hers for twenty extra years of sleep.

17
00:00:53,080 --> 00:00:55,160
A butcher sold his to forget the war.

18
00:00:55,160 --> 00:00:57,960
Felix, as it turns out, had a gift.

19
00:00:57,960 --> 00:01:01,320
He could untie a shadow from your feet like untying a shoelace.

20
00:01:01,320 --> 00:01:01,880
It made him...

21
00:01:01,880 --> 00:01:02,600
popular.

22
00:01:02,600 --> 00:01:11,000
By the time the moon was high, he'd bought a shadow that told jokes, one that could open locked doors, and another that kept perfect time like a metronome.

23
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:12,040
Years passed.

24
00:01:12,040 --> 00:01:13,720
Felix became a legend.

25
00:01:13,720 --> 00:01:15,760
People lined up to lighten their burdens.

26
00:01:15,760 --> 00:01:19,680
To sell the parts of themselves they no longer wanted to carry in the light.

27
00:01:19,680 --> 00:01:24,000
But one day, a girl came to him and said, "I want yours." He laughed.

28
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:24,880
"Mine?

29
00:01:24,880 --> 00:01:25,800
It's stubborn.

30
00:01:25,800 --> 00:01:30,200
Doesn't even follow me properly anymore." "I don't need it to follow," she said.

31
00:01:30,200 --> 00:01:32,840
"Just to remember." Felix was quiet.

32
00:01:32,840 --> 00:01:36,680
For the first time, he looked behind him - and saw nothing.

33
00:01:36,680 --> 00:01:38,640
Just a trail of old footsteps.

34
00:01:38,640 --> 00:01:40,040
And then he realized...

35
00:01:40,040 --> 00:01:42,000
He hadn't seen his shadow in years.
