1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,480
They say in the town of Widdershade, people don't cast shadows after sunset.

2
00:00:04,480 --> 00:00:05,600
It's not magic.

3
00:00:05,600 --> 00:00:06,640
It's Felix.

4
00:00:06,640 --> 00:00:09,400
Felix Holloway wasn’t always a shadow collector.

5
00:00:09,400 --> 00:00:13,120
He started out as a quiet cobbler with bad eyesight and a worse memory.

6
00:00:13,120 --> 00:00:20,600
But one cloudy evening, while fixing a boot by candlelight, he noticed something odd — the customer’s shadow stepped away from him.

7
00:00:20,600 --> 00:00:23,760
It yawned, stretched, and disappeared out the window.

8
00:00:23,760 --> 00:00:24,760
Felix blinked.

9
00:00:24,760 --> 00:00:25,800
Twice.

10
00:00:25,800 --> 00:00:28,480
Then did what any sane man would: he followed it.

11
00:00:28,480 --> 00:00:37,760
He chased the shadow through cobbled alleys, up a twisted oak tree, and into a hole behind the apothecary, where — to his absolute confusion — he found a market.

12
00:00:37,760 --> 00:00:38,840
Not for fruit.

13
00:00:38,840 --> 00:00:39,920
Not for shoes.

14
00:00:39,920 --> 00:00:41,200
But for shadows.

15
00:00:41,200 --> 00:00:49,240
Tall ones, crooked ones, shadows that danced when you whistled — all hanging on clotheslines, whispering like curtains in the wind.

16
00:00:49,240 --> 00:00:52,840
A woman with silver eyes traded hers for twenty extra years of sleep.

17
00:00:52,840 --> 00:00:54,960
A butcher sold his to forget the war.

18
00:00:54,960 --> 00:00:57,760
Felix, as it turns out, had a gift.

19
00:00:57,760 --> 00:01:01,120
He could untie a shadow from your feet like untying a shoelace.

20
00:01:01,120 --> 00:01:01,800
It made him.

21
00:01:01,800 --> 00:01:02,400
popular.

22
00:01:02,400 --> 00:01:10,760
By the time the moon was high, he'd bought a shadow that told jokes, one that could open locked doors, and another that kept perfect time like a metronome.

23
00:01:10,760 --> 00:01:11,840
Years passed.

24
00:01:11,840 --> 00:01:13,440
Felix became a legend.

25
00:01:13,440 --> 00:01:15,760
People lined up to lighten their burdens.

26
00:01:15,760 --> 00:01:19,440
To sell the parts of themselves they no longer wanted to carry in the light.

27
00:01:19,440 --> 00:01:23,160
But one day, a girl came to him and said,
"I want yours.

28
00:01:23,160 --> 00:01:24,000
"

He laughed.

29
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:24,640
“Mine?

30
00:01:24,640 --> 00:01:25,560
It’s stubborn.

31
00:01:25,560 --> 00:01:27,960
Doesn’t even follow me properly anymore.

32
00:01:27,960 --> 00:01:30,200
”

“I don’t need it to follow,” she said.

33
00:01:30,200 --> 00:01:31,280
“Just to remember.

34
00:01:31,280 --> 00:01:32,640
”

Felix was quiet.

35
00:01:32,640 --> 00:01:36,440
For the first time, he looked behind him — and saw nothing.

36
00:01:36,440 --> 00:01:38,440
Just a trail of old footsteps.

37
00:01:38,440 --> 00:01:42,000
And then he realized…
He hadn’t seen his shadow in years.
